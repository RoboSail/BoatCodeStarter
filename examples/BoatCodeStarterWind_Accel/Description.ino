/* 
This program contains starter code for programming a boat 
using information from the Wind Sensor and the Accelerometer (tilt sensor)
For detailed information about getting input from the WindSensor,
input from the RC receiver, and sending output to the Servos,
see these programs: WindSensorTest, accelerometerXYZtest, and RCPassThrough

Program values are displayed to the Serial Monitor when the 
variable "displayValues" is set to true.  Otherwise set displayValues to false.
